Waste Classification System
CREATED FOR PJAS
This project aims to leverage machine learning and mobile technology to accurately classify waste into various categories, facilitating proper recycling and disposal. The system uses a pre-trained VGG-16 model customized for waste classification, integrated with a Flask server backend, and accessible through a user-friendly mobile app.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a modified VGG-16 model for accurate image-based waste classification.
Mobile Application: An easy-to-use mobile app that allows users to upload waste images for classification.
Flask Server: A robust Flask server that handles image processing and model inference.
Multi-Country Support: Customizable for different waste classification standards across countries.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch and torchvision
Flask
React Native environment setup
Expo CLI
Installation
Clone the repository

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-classification-system.git
cd waste-classification-system
Set up the Python environment

sh
Copy code
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Flask server

sh
Copy code
python server.py
Set up and run the mobile app

Navigate to the mobile app directory and install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
cd mobile-app
npm install
Start the app with Expo:

sh
Copy code
expo start
Usage
Mobile App: Open the app on your device using the Expo client. Select a country, then choose or take a photo of the waste item. The app will display the classification result.

Flask Server: The server accepts POST requests at /predict with an image file and country parameter. It returns the classification result in JSON format.
